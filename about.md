## TL;DR

## Welcome

Hi there, and welcome to my digital home.

I'm Shrey Anand. *Anand* means “happiness,” and *Shrey* — derived from the Sanskrit *श्रेय* — is often interpreted as “long-term fulfillment.” Together, they sum up my personal and professional ethos: a focus on meaningful, lasting impact over short-term gratification.

I've been fortunate to grow up in a supportive environment that encouraged curiosity. That curiosity became the engine behind my pursuit of understanding how systems — biological, computational, economic, and social — work.

## What I Do

Professionally, I apply data science to real-world challenges at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com), a leading open-source and hybrid cloud platform. My work involves:

- Framing business problems into data science questions  
- Conducting reproducible, scalable experiments  
- Presenting insights that inform automation, optimization, and product strategy  

My goal is to reduce cognitive and operational overhead for software engineers, empowering them to focus on creativity and innovation.

Beyond the day job, I explore intersections of machine learning, systems design, and behavioral data — especially where human well-being and technology meet.

## What Drives Me

I’m energized by systems that improve human life — whether it's through data-informed health insights, automation that boosts creative potential, or tools that deepen communication.

Expression is key to how I engage with the world. Whether through code, writing, or music, I see creativity as both a personal outlet and a means of connection.

I track and experiment with my own data — from sleep and training patterns to financial habits — to better understand what sustains clarity, resilience, and joy in modern life.

## Who I Am

At the core, I’m a systems thinker with a human-first mindset. I’m interested in how people grow, connect, and find meaning. While my background is in engineering, I’ve come to value emotional intelligence and communication as critical tools for both leadership and collaboration.

Some of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned have come from open, honest conversations with people across ages and industries. If you’d like to share your perspective or explore ideas, I’d love to hear from you.
